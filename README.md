# Simple CI/CD Pipeline

This repository contains a simple web application along with a Jenkins pipeline configuration for continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD). The project demonstrates the automation of build, test, and deployment processes using Jenkins, helping to streamline development workflows and ensure code quality.

## Project Overview

- **Web Application**: A basic Node.js/Python web application.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: A Jenkins pipeline that automates the following tasks:
  - Pulls code from GitHub
  - Builds the application
  - Runs unit tests
  - Deploys the application to a local server

## Technologies Used

- **Jenkins**: For CI/CD pipeline automation
- **Docker**: For containerization (if applicable)
- **Node.js/Python**: For the web application
- **GitHub**: For version control
